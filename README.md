# Dojo_project
Dojo Project with Django
Final Project for Coding Dojo
My idea is to create a baseball stadium tracking app where users can share what are their favorite stadiums they have visited while adding likes and comments functionality.
- Utilitizing HTML, CSS, and JS for front-end
- Utilizing Python and Django for the back-end and web framework
- Utilizing MySQL for the database
